# Easter_eggs

Welcome to the modular easter eggs scripts repository. You will be able to create a full easter eggs with your own steps through a drag & drop system. The easter eggs can be added to any script, but I will provide a start script that you can use as base.

This tutorial is going to be as easy as it gets, however you do need a small amount of understanding to how scripting works. Everything in this guide will be layed out for you, and you can easily just drag the scripts in.
